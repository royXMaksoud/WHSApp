WarehouseApp - ASP.NET Core Application

Overview

The WarehouseApp is a robust and scalable application built using ASP.NET Core. It incorporates industry-standard design principles and patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability. This application is a great example of how to implement Mediator pattern and SOLID principles in an ASP.NET Core environment.

Key Features
- Mediator Pattern: Utilizes the Mediator design pattern for handling communication between different parts of the application, allowing for loose coupling and better maintainability.
- SOLID Principles: Follows the SOLID principles to ensure clean, maintainable, and testable code.
- ASP.NET Core Best Practices: Built using ASP.NET Core with an emphasis on scalability, performance, and security.
- Modular Architecture: Divided into well-defined layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Web API) to ensure separation of concerns.

Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:
- ASP.NET Core 6/7
- Entity Framework Core for data access
- MediatR for implementing the Mediator pattern
- AutoMapper for object mapping
- Dependency Injection for decoupling services
- Swagger for API documentation

---

Architecture

The project is organized into several core layers to promote clean architecture and separation of concerns:
- Domain: Contains the core business models and entities.
- Application: Implements business logic and uses MediatR for handling requests and responses.
- Infrastructure: Deals with external concerns like database access, file storage, and external APIs.
- Web API: Exposes the core functionality of the application to users via HTTP endpoints.

Mediator Pattern

The Mediator pattern is used in this project to reduce dependencies between the components of the application. It allows requests and commands to be passed through a Mediator object instead of communicating directly with each other.

Why MediatR?
- Loose Coupling: By using MediatR, different parts of the application don’t need to reference each other directly, which helps to reduce interdependencies.
- Single Responsibility: Each request handler focuses only on handling a single request, making the application easier to maintain and extend.
- Improved Testability: It’s easier to test the individual request handlers as they are decoupled from other components.

In this project, MediatR is used to handle commands and queries between different parts of the application. Here is an example of how a command handler looks:

public class CreateProductCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<CreateProductCommand, bool>
{
    private readonly IProductRepository _productRepository;

    public CreateProductCommandHandler(IProductRepository productRepository)
    {
        _productRepository = productRepository;
    }

    public async Task<bool> Handle(CreateProductCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var product = new Product
        {
            Name = request.Name,
            Quantity = request.Quantity,
            Price = request.Price
        };

        await _productRepository.AddAsync(product);
        return true;
    }
}

SOLID Principles

This project adheres to the SOLID principles, which are the foundation of writing maintainable and scalable software.

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class has one responsibility. For example, request handlers in MediatR focus solely on handling requests and performing actions, not on handling UI or database logic.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The system is open for extension but closed for modification. For instance, adding new commands or queries does not require changing the existing codebase, just adding new handlers.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In this application, base classes for repository interfaces and service classes are properly extended.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
We prefer creating smaller, focused interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones. For instance, each service interface focuses only on specific operations (e.g., IProductService, IOrderService).

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules. Both depend on abstractions. We inject dependencies through constructors, which makes the system more flexible and testable.

Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WarehouseApp.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd WarehouseApp

3. Restore the NuGet packages:
   dotnet restore

4. Apply migrations (if using Entity Framework Core):
   dotnet ef database update

5. Run the project:
   dotnet run

   The application will start locally on http://localhost:5000.

---

Usage

- The Web API can be accessed through HTTP endpoints.
- You can interact with the API via Swagger UI or tools like Postman or cURL.
- Swagger UI will be available at http://localhost:5000/swagger.
